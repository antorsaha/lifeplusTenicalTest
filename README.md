Something about MVVM architecture
Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is an architectural pattern used to separate the concerns of an application, making it easier to manage and test. It divides the application into three core components: Model, View, and ViewModel. Model handles data operations such as fetching data from a database, rest API, or any other data source. view is responsible for displaying the data and updates in response to user actions. ViewModel is responsible for acts as a bridge between the Model and the View.
